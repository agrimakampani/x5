Description:


Title: todo list

Problem: As college students tend to take more than four courses per semester, they need a better system for them to know what assignments they should finish and what are the due dates for those assignments as well.

Primary Stakeholders: students 

Graphical User interface:
-First, display a list of courses which the users are currently enrolled
-Then the user can click the desired course icon to read the to do list for this course.
-Inside the to do list, there will be nothing fancy or complicated graph but a list of straight forward bullet-points tasks that need to be done.
 -the name of the assignment
 -due date

Data Structure:
-linked list
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Input Data File Format: Provide a sample input data file for each type of data needed by your program.


Output Example: Provide an example image of the output possible from the program.  This example may be drawn, or created using any word or image editor program of your choice.


Milestones: Describe discrete points or independent units, where parts of the project's functionality can be completed and can be tested or demonstrated independently of the final overall program.  Organize or order your milestones so that you can complete the most independent parts first, and then build on those working parts or prototypes.
