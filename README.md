Members: Agrima Kampani(kampani@wisc.edu), Isaac Weber(iweber2@wisc.edu), James Watson(jcwatson2@wisc.edu), Tony Zhou(zzhou366@wisc.edu)


Description:


Problem: What problem does your program solve?


Primary stakeholder: Who will be the primary user your program?


Graphical User interface: Revise and update the sketches of the user interface screens, menus, and options.


Data Structure: What type of ADT or data structures will be needed and used  by your program?


Input Data File Format: Provide a sample input data file for each type of data needed by your program.


Output Example: Provide an example image of the output possible from the program.  This example may be drawn, or created using any word or image editor program of your choice.


Milestones: Describe discrete points or independent units, where parts of the project's functionality can be completed and can be tested or demonstrated independently of the final overall program.  Organize or order your milestones so that you can complete the most independent parts first, and then build on those working parts or prototypes.
